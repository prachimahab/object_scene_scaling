	<font color="black">Thank you for your interest in this <strong>Human Intelligence Task (HIT)</strong>.Please read the instructions very carefully</font>
</p>

<p>
	<font color="black"> In this task you will see different objects on top of different scenes. 
		On each trial you will a fixation cross followed by a scene with an object placed in the center. 
		This image will appear for a brief amount of time, followed by an image of colored squares.

	</font>
</p>

<p> Your task is to respond <strong>'Do the two scenes belong to the same category?' </strong> 
	
</p>

In the experiment, scenes will be from one of four categories: kitchen, bathroom, classroom, or laundromat (see examples below). 
Your task is to respond if the two scenes belong to the same or different category from this list. 


For the practice, scenes will either be indoor or outdoor. 


<img src="example_scenes.png" class="center" style="width:830px;height:350px;"/>

<p> If you believe the two scenes are of the same category, press the "c" key on your keyboard. 
	If the scenes are of different categories, then press the "m" key on your keyboard.</p>

<p> For example, if you see two bedroom scenes then you should respond 'c'. 
	If the first scene is a bedroom, and the second is living room then you should respond 'm'. </p>

<p>You can respond as soon as you see the second scene! </p>

<p> Please respond as quickly and accurately as possible. When you answer incorrectly, the fixation cross will turn red (<font color=red>+</font>).
	Try to slow down if you see you are getting many wrong!
